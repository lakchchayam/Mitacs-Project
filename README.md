## Project description


# udes-dsc-cie
Data Supply Chain : Canadian Public Companies

# Description
This project is linked to the MITACS program. The objective is to automate key activities in competitive intelligence using OSINT. The vision includes :
- Listing Canadian Public Companies
- Gathering annual financial reports
- Processing reports
  - Extracting management team
  - Extracting board members
  - Extraction key financial figures
  - Extracting specific sections (ex. Corporate social responsibility)
- Leadership background analysis (education, positions)
- Leadership profile (ex. gender) and network analysis
- Official social media outlets monitoring
- Alternative information outlets monitoring.

Obviously this presentation is beyond a single project and translate to an ambitious program. It is however important to see the big picture to work efficiently on any of the part. The MITACS project will target the first phases and perhaps key interesting problems using an Agile process.

## Project Title
Systematic Analysis of the Business Environment : Big Data, Text Mining and Artificial intelligence

## Project Goal
Implement a basic data science workflow based on analytics, text mining and AI to support the activity of analysis of corporate documents.  
## Project Timeline
- Week 1-3 : Literature review, process modelling, data acquisition development
- Week 4-6 : data preparation,  data analysis, insight rendering development : iteration 1 (basic workflow)
- Week 7-8 : data preparation,  data analysis, insight rendering development : iteration 2 (broadening of analyses)
- Week 9-10 : data preparation,  data analysis, insight rendering development : iteration 3 (increase in data)
- Week 11-12 : project finalisation and presentation
## Project Deliverables
- Basic data collection tool
- Text mining and network analysis workflow
- Insight visualization interface
- List of key papers on the subject
- Project slidedeck 
- Project report

## Project Interactions
The candidate and the researcher will meet on a weekly basis. Other researchers at UdeS may join the conversation on specific topics. The candidate will be asked to present its work to student and staff at UdeS at the end of the internship. I also have a second MITACS project. Candidates will be encouraged to share experiences, tips and insights throughout the project to sustain personal motivation.
